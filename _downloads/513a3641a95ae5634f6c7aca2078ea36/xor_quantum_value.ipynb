        "That is, the :code:`prob_mat` matrix encapsulates that each question pair\n$\\{(0,0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\\}$ is equally likely.\n\nThe :code:`pred_mat` matrix indicates what the winning outcome of Alice and Bob\nshould be. For instance, :code:`pred_mat[0][0] = 0` describes the scenario where\nAlice and Bob both receive $0$ as input. As we want to satisfy the\nwinning condition $x \\land y = a \\oplus b$, we must have that $a\n\\oplus b = 0$ to satisfy the case when both $x$ and $y$ are equal\nto zero. A similar logic can be followed to populate the remaining entries of\nthe :code:`pred_mat` variable.\n\nWe will use both of the :code:`prob_mat` and :code:`pred_mat` variables in the\ncoming subsections to make use of the :code:`|toqito\u27e9` package to compute both the\nclassical and quantum value of the CHSH game.\n\n### A classical strategy for the CHSH game\n\nWe can begin by asking; is it possible for Alice and Bob to win for every\nsingle question pair they receive with certainty? If Alice and Bob use a\nclassical strategy, the answer to this question is \"no\". To see why, consider\nthe following equations:\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{equation}\n       \\begin{aligned}\n           a_0 \\oplus b_0 = 0, \\quad a_0 \\oplus b_1 = 0, \\\\\n           a_1 \\oplus b_0 = 0, \\quad a_1 \\oplus b_1 = 1.\n       \\end{aligned}\n   \\end{equation}\\end{align}\n\nIn the above equation, $a_x$ is Alice's answer in the event that she\nreceives question $x$ from the referee for $x \\in \\Sigma_A$.\nSimilarly, $b_y$ is Bob's answer when Bob receives question $y$\nfrom the referee for $y \\in \\Sigma_B$. These equations express the\nwinning conditions that Alice and Bob must satisfy in order to perfectly win\nthe CHSH game. That is, if it's possible to satisfy all of these equations\nsimultaneously, it's not possible for them to lose.\n\nOne could perform a brute-force check to see that there is no possible way for\nAlice and Bob to simultaneously satisfy all four equations. The best they can\ndo is satisfy three out of the four equations\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{equation}\n       \\begin{aligned}\n           a_0 \\oplus b_0 = 0, \\quad a_0 \\oplus b_1 = 0, \\\\\n           a_1 \\oplus b_0 = 0.\n       \\end{aligned}\n   \\end{equation}\\end{align}\n\nThey can achieve this if they either have answers $a_0 = b_0 = a_1 = b_1\n= 0$ or $a_0 = b_0 = a_1 = b_1 = 1$.\n\nSince it is not possible to satisfy all four equations, but it is possible to\nsatisfy three out of the four equations, the classical value of the CHSH game\nis $3/4$, or stated in an equivalent way\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{equation}\n       \\omega(G_{CHSH}) = 3/4 = 0.75.\n   \\end{equation}\\end{align}\n\nWe can verify this by making use of :code:`|toqito\u27e9` to compute the classical\nvalue of the CHSH game.\n\n"

        "### A quantum strategy for the CHSH game\n\nWhat is very intriguing about the CHSH game is that it is an example of a\nnonlocal game where the players can do *strictly better* if they make use of a\nquantum strategy instead of a classical one. The quantum strategy that allows\nthe players to do strictly better is composed of the following shared state and\nsets of measurements.\n\n* State: The players prepare and share the state:\n\n   .. math::\n       \\begin{equation}\n           | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n           \\left(| 00 \\rangle + | 11 \\rangle \\right).\n       \\end{equation}\n\n* Measurements: The players measure with respect to the following basis\n\n   .. math::\n       \\begin{equation}\n           | \\phi_0 \\rangle = \\cos(\\theta)|0 \\rangle + \\sin(\\theta)|1 \\rangle, \\quad\n           | \\phi_1 \\rangle = -\\sin(\\theta)|0 \\rangle + \\cos(\\theta)|1 \\rangle,\n       \\end{equation}\n\n  such that\n\n  * If $x = 0$ Alice sets $\\theta = 0$.\n    Otherwise, if $x = 1$, Alice sets $\\theta = \\pi/4$.\n\n  * If $y = 0$ Bob sets $\\theta = \\pi/8$.\n    Otherwise, if $y = 1$, Bob sets $\\theta = -\\pi/8$.\n\n\nWe can now analyze how well this particular quantum strategy performs by\nanalyzing what occurs in each of the four possible scenarios. For brevity, we\nwill just analyze the first case, but analyzing the remaining cases follows a\nsimilar analysis.\n\n* Case: $x = 0, y = 0$:\n\n  In this case, Alice and Bob win if $a = b = 0$ or if $a = b = 1$.\n  Alice receives question $x$ and selects her measurements constructed from\n  the basis as specified in the strategy.\n\n  .. math::\n     \\begin{equation}\n         A_0^0 = | \\phi_0 \\rangle \\langle \\phi_0 |\n         \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n         A_1^0 = | \\phi_1 \\rangle \\langle \\phi_1 |\n     \\end{equation}\n\n  where\n\n  .. math::\n     \\begin{equation}\n         \\begin{aligned}\n             | \\phi_0 \\rangle &= \\cos(0)| 0 \\rangle + \\sin(0)| 1 \\rangle, \\\\\n             | \\phi_1 \\rangle &= -\\sin(0)| 0 \\rangle + \\cos(0)| 1 \\rangle.\n         \\end{aligned}\n     \\end{equation}\n\n  In a similar way, since Bob receives question $y = 0$, he selects his\n  measurements from the basis\n\n  .. math::\n     \\begin{equation}\n         \\begin{aligned}\n             | \\phi_0 \\rangle &= \\cos(\\pi/8)| 0 \\rangle + \\sin(\\pi/8)| 1 \\rangle, \\\\\n             | \\phi_1 \\rangle &= -\\sin(\\pi/8)| 0 \\rangle + \\cos(\\pi/8)| 1 \\rangle.\n         \\end{aligned}\n     \\end{equation}\n\n  where the measurement operators themselves are defined as\n\n  .. math::\n     \\begin{equation}\n         B_0^0 = | \\phi_0 \\rangle\n         \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n         B_1^0 = | \\phi_1 \\rangle \\langle \\phi_1 |\n     \\end{equation}.\n\n  Using these measurements, we can calculate the probability that Alice and Bob\n  win on the inputs $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ as\n\n  .. math::\n     \\begin{equation}\n         p(a, b|0, 0) = \\langle \\psi | A_0^0 \\otimes B_0^0 | \\psi \\rangle +\n                        \\langle \\psi | A_1^0 \\otimes B_1^0 | \\psi \\rangle.\n     \\end{equation}\n\nCalculating the above equation and normalizing by a factor of $1/4$, we\nobtain the value of $\\cos^2(\\pi/8)$. Calculating the remaining three\ncases of $(x = 0, y = 1), (x = 1, y = 0)$, and $(x = 1, y = 1)$\nfollow a similar analysis.\n\nWe can see that using this quantum strategy the players win the CHSH game with\na probability of $\\cos^2(\\pi/8) \\approx 0.85355$, which is quite a bit\nbetter than the best classical strategy yielding a probability of $3/4$\nto win. As it turns out, the winning probability $\\cos^2(\\pi/8)$ using a\nquantum strategy is optimal, which we can represent as\n$\\omega^*(G_{CHSH}) = \\cos^2(\\pi/8)$.\n\nWe can calculate the quantum value of the CHSH game using :code:`|toqito\u27e9` as\nfollows:\n\n"
