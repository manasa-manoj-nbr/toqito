.. py:function:: mutual_coherence(vectors)

   Calculate the mutual coherence of a collection of input vectors.

   The mutual coherence of a collection of input vectors is defined as the maximum
   absolute value of the inner product between any two distinct vectors, divided by the
   product of their norms :footcite:`WikiMutualCoh`. It provides a measure of how
   similar the vectors are to each other.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   .. jupyter-execute::

       import numpy as np
       from toqito.matrix_props.mutual_coherence import mutual_coherence
       example_A = [np.array([1, 0]), np.array([0, 1])]
       print("Result for example_A = ",mutual_coherence(example_A))
       # An example with a larger set of vectors
       example_B = [np.array([1, 0, 1]), np.array([0, 1, 1]), np.array([1, 1, 0])]
       print("Result for example_B = ",mutual_coherence(example_B))
