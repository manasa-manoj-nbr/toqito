.. py:function:: in_separable_ball(mat)

   Check whether an operator is contained in ball of separability :footcite:`Gurvits_2002_Largest`.

   Determines whether :code:`mat` is contained within the ball of separable operators centered
   at the identity matrix (i.e. the maximally-mixed state). The size of this ball was derived in
   :footcite:`Gurvits_2002_Largest`.

   This function can be used as a method for separability testing of states in certain scenarios.

   This function is adapted from QETLAB.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   The only states acting on :math:`\mathbb{C}^m \otimes \mathbb{C}^n` in the
   separable ball that do not have full rank are those with exactly 1 zero
   eigenvalue, and the :math:`mn - 1` non-zero eigenvalues equal to each
   other.

   The following is an example of generating a random density matrix with eigenvalues
   :code:`[1, 1, 1, 0]/3`. This example yields a matrix that is contained within the separable
   ball.

   .. jupyter-execute::

       from toqito.rand import random_unitary
       from toqito.state_props import in_separable_ball
       import numpy as np
       U = random_unitary(4)
       lam = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0]) / 3
       rho = U @ np.diag(lam) @ U.conj().T
       in_separable_ball(rho)

   The following is an example of generating a random density matrix with eigenvalues
   :code:`[1.01, 1, 0.99, 0]/3`. This example yields a matrix that is not contained within the
   separable ball.

   .. jupyter-execute::

       from toqito.rand import random_unitary
       from toqito.state_props import in_separable_ball
       import numpy as np
       U = random_unitary(4)
       lam = np.array([1.01, 1, 0.99, 0]) / 3
       rho = U @ np.diag(lam) @ U.conj().T
       in_separable_ball(rho)

   :param mat: A positive semidefinite matrix or a vector of the eigenvalues of a positive
               semidefinite matrix.
   :return: :code:`True` if the matrix :code:`mat` is contained within the separable ball, and
           :code:`False` otherwise.
