   Compute the optimal probability of distinguishing two quantum channels.

   Bayesian and minimax discrimination of two quantum channels are implemented.

   For Bayesian discrimination, channels to be distinguished should have a given a priori probability distribution.
   The task of discriminating channels can be connected to the completely bounded trace norm
   (Section 3.3.3 of :footcite:`Watrous_2018_TQI`).
   The problem is finding POVMs for which error probability of discrimination of
   output states is minimized after input state is acted on by the two quantum channels.
   In the language of statistical decision theory, the problem is equivalent to minimizing quantum Bayes' risk.

   In the minimax problem, there are no a priori probabilities.
   Minimax discrimination of two channels consists of finding the
   optimal input state so that the two possible output states are discriminated
   with minimum risk. (:footcite:`d2005minimax`).

   QETLAB's functionality inspired the Bayesian option  :footcite:`QETLAB_link`
   and the minimax option is adapted from  QuTIpy :footcite:`QuTIpy_link`.


   .. rubric:: Examples

   Optimal probability of distinguishing two amplitude damping channels in the Bayesian setting:

   .. jupyter-execute::

       from toqito.channels import amplitude_damping
       from toqito.channel_ops import kraus_to_choi
       from toqito.channel_metrics import channel_distinguishability
       # Define two amplitude damping channels with gamma=0.25 and gamma=0.5
       choi_ch_1 = kraus_to_choi(amplitude_damping(gamma=0.25))
       choi_ch_2 = kraus_to_choi(amplitude_damping(gamma=0.5))

       p = [0.5, 0.5]

       channel_distinguishability(choi_ch_1, choi_ch_2, p)

   Optimal probability of distinguishing two amplitude damping channels in the minimax setting:

   .. jupyter-execute::

       from toqito.channels import amplitude_damping
       from toqito.channel_ops import kraus_to_choi
       from toqito.channel_metrics import channel_distinguishability
       # Define two amplitude damping channels with gamma=0.25 and gamma=0.5
       choi_ch_1 = kraus_to_choi(amplitude_damping(gamma=0.25))
       choi_ch_2 = kraus_to_choi(amplitude_damping(gamma=0.5))
