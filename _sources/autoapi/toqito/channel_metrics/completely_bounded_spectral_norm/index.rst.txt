   Computes the completely bounded spectral norm of a quantum channel.





Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: completely_bounded_spectral_norm(phi)

   Compute the completely bounded spectral norm of a quantum channel.

   As defined in :footcite:`Watrous_2009_Semidefinite` and :footcite:`QETLAB_link`.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   To computer the completely bounded spectral norm of a depolarizing channel,

   .. jupyter-execute::

       from toqito.channels import depolarizing
       from toqito.channel_metrics import completely_bounded_spectral_norm
       # Define the depolarizing channel
       choi_depolarizing = depolarizing(dim=2, param_p=0.2)
       completely_bounded_spectral_norm(choi_depolarizing)
