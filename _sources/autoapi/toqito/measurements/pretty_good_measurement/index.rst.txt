   Compute the set of pretty good measurements from an ensemble.





Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: pretty_good_measurement(states, probs = None, tol = 1e-08)

   Return the set of pretty good measurements from a set of vectors and corresponding probabilities.

   This computes the "pretty good measurement" (PGM), also known as the
   square-root measurement, which is a widely used measurement for quantum
   state discrimination :footcite:`Belavkin_1975_Optimal,Hughston_1993_Complete`.

   The PGM is the set of POVMs :math:`(G_1, \ldots, G_n)` such that

   .. math::
       G_i = P^{-1/2} \left(p_i \rho_i\right) P^{-1/2} \quad \text{where} \quad
       P = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \rho_i.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Consider the collection of trine states.

   .. math::
       u_0 = |0\rangle, \quad
       u_1 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle + \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right), \quad \text{and} \quad
       u_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle - \sqrt{3}|1\rangle\right).

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.states import trine
    from toqito.measurements import pretty_good_measurement

    states = trine()
    probs = [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3]
    pgm = pretty_good_measurement(states, probs)
    pgm
