.. py:function:: random_unitary(dim, is_real = False, seed = None)

   Generate a random unitary or orthogonal matrix :footcite:`Ozols_2009_RandU`.

   Calculates a random unitary matrix (if :code:`is_real = False`) or a random real orthogonal
   matrix (if :code:`is_real = True`), uniformly distributed according to the Haar measure.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   We may generate a random unitary matrix. Here is an example of how we may be able to generate a
   random :math:`2`-dimensional random unitary matrix with complex entries.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.rand import random_unitary

    complex_dm = random_unitary(2)

    complex_dm

   We can verify that this is in fact a valid unitary matrix using the :code:`is_unitary` function
   from :code:`|toqito⟩` as follows

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

    is_unitary(complex_dm)

   We can also generate random unitary matrices that are real-valued as follows.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.rand import random_unitary

    real_dm = random_unitary(2, True)

    real_dm


   Again, verifying that this is a valid unitary matrix can be done as follows.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

    is_unitary(real_dm)

   We may also generate unitaries such that the dimension argument provided is a :code:`list` as
   opposed to an :code:`int`. Here is an example of a random unitary matrix of dimension :math:`4`.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.rand import random_unitary

    mat = random_unitary([4, 4], True)

    mat


   As before, we can verify that this matrix generated is a valid unitary matrix.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

    is_unitary(mat)

   It is also possible to pass a seed to this function for reproducibility.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

    seeded = random_unitary(2, seed=42)

    seeded

   And once again, we can verify that this matrix generated is a valid unitary matrix.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.matrix_props import is_unitary

    is_unitary(seeded)

   .. rubric:: References

   .. footbibliography::

   :param dim: The number of rows (and columns) of the unitary matrix.
   :param is_real: Boolean denoting whether the returned matrix has real
                   entries or not. Default is :code:`False`.
   :param seed: A seed used to instantiate numpy's random number generator.
   :return: A :code:`dim`-by-:code:`dim` random unitary matrix.
