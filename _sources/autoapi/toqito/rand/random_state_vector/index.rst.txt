   Generates a random state vector.

.. py:function:: random_state_vector(dim, is_real = False, k_param = 0, seed = None)

   Generate a random pure state vector.

   Randomness model
   ----------------

   We sample entries independently from the standard normal distribution using ``numpy``'s
   ``default_rng``.  If ``is_real`` is ``False`` (default), the imaginary part is sampled in the
   same way and added with the factor :math:`i`; otherwise the vector is real.  The sampled vector
   is normalized to have unit Euclidean norm.  When ``k_param`` is strictly positive, the returned
   state describes a bipartite system of dimensions ``dim`` (or ``[dim, dim]`` if ``dim`` is an
   integer) with Schmidt rank at most ``k_param``.  This is achieved by drawing local factors and
   combining them with a maximally entangled resource state.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   We may generate a random state vector. For instance, here is an example where we can generate a
   :math:`2`-dimensional random state vector.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.rand import random_state_vector

    vec = random_state_vector(2)

    vec

   We can verify that this is in fact a valid state vector by computing the corresponding density
   matrix of the vector and checking if the density matrix is pure.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.state_props import is_pure

    dm = vec @ vec.conj().T

    is_pure(dm)

   It is also possible to pass a seed for reproducibility.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.rand import random_state_vector

    vec = random_state_vector(2, seed=42)

    vec

   We can once again verify that this is in fact a valid state vector by computing the
   corresponding density matrix of the vector and checking if the density matrix is pure.

   .. jupyter-execute::

    from toqito.state_props import is_pure

    dm = vec @ vec.conj().T

    is_pure(dm)

   :param dim: Either a positive integer giving the total Hilbert-space dimension, or a length-2
       sequence specifying the individual subsystem dimensions for bipartite sampling.
   :param is_real: Boolean denoting whether the returned vector has real entries. Default is
       :code:`False`, which produces complex amplitudes.
   :param k_param: Optional upper bound on the Schmidt rank when ``dim`` describes a bipartite
       system.  Set to :code:`0` (default) to ignore the Schmidt rank constraint.  Must be
       non-negative and strictly less than the smaller subsystem dimension when used.
   :param seed: A seed used to instantiate numpy's random number generator.
   :return: A normalized column vector of shape ``(total_dim, 1)`` where ``total_dim`` equals
       :code:`dim` if ``dim`` is an integer and equals the product of entries in ``dim``
       otherwise.
